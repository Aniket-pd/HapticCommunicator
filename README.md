# HapticCommunicator Tutorial

This guide provides a hands‑on tutorial for caregivers and users on how to operate the **HapticCommunicator** iOS app. The app converts text and speech to Morse code vibrations so that a user with limited vision or hearing can communicate through haptics.

## 1. Overview

The app has three tabs:

1. **User Modes** – screen for the disabled user to input or receive messages using taps and speech.
2. **Caregiver** – screen for the caregiver to type a message and hand the phone to the user so they can feel the vibration.
3. **Settings** – adjust vibration speed and sound feedback.

## 2. Trying the User Modes tab

1. Launch the app. The **User Modes** tab opens by default.
2. Tap anywhere in the large open area:
   - A short tap registers a `·` (dot) with a quick haptic.
   - A longer press registers a `−` (dash).
3. Swipe right to insert a space between letters.
4. Swipe up to convert the Morse code into text. The decoded text and Morse history appear in the scrolling area above.

### Listening with speech recognition

1. Press and hold anywhere for about **2 seconds** until the screen says *“I'm Listening”*.
2. Speak clearly while holding your finger down. The app shows the recognized text and its Morse translation in real time.
3. Release your finger or tap the screen to stop listening. The recognized message is added to the history and can be replayed as vibration.

### Playing messages back

Each speech message in the history includes its Morse code. When a message is selected for playback, the app highlights each symbol as it vibrates so the user can follow along.

## 3. Using the Caregiver tab

1. Switch to the **Caregiver** tab.
2. Type a short phrase (e.g. `Hello`).
3. Tap **“Convert to Morse Code.”** A sheet appears showing your text and its Morse version.
4. Hand the phone to the user and ask them to tap anywhere on the screen. The app vibrates the Morse code at the selected speed so the user can read it through touch.

## 4. Adjusting Settings

1. Open the **Settings** tab.
2. Choose a vibration speed under **Haptic Speed.** Use *Very Slow* when first teaching the user, then gradually increase as they become comfortable.
3. Enable or disable the **Beep Sound** and **Speech Sound** toggles depending on the user’s preferences.
4. The **Demo** section shows how the current speed feels by vibrating “This is your current text.”

## 5. Teaching a new user

1. Start with the app set to **Very Slow** speed.
2. Demonstrate dots and dashes by tapping yourself while the user holds the phone.
3. Have the user practice tapping a few simple letters such as `E` (`·`) and `T` (`−`).
4. Move on to short words, swiping up to send each word so they see the decoded result.
5. Practice receiving messages: in the Caregiver tab, type simple words, hand over the phone, and let them feel the vibration.
6. As the user becomes proficient, speed up the haptics in Settings.
7. Encourage combining voice input with manual taps so communication is fast and flexible.
